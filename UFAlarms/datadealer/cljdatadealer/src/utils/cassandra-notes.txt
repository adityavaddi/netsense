The steps needed to setup cassandra and seed it.
Ultimately this should be linked with the platform setup wiki.

When creating key-space, replication parameters have to be provided in the following format.

(cql/create-keyspace conn "cassaforte_keyspace"
                   (with {:replication
                          {:class "SimpleStrategy"
                           :replication_factor 1}}))

There is one other strategy called NetworkTopologyStrategy, which doesn't require replication factor parameter.

NetworkTopologyStrategy - should be used when multiple data centers are used.
