Navigating projects interactively
=================================
 

At the sbt interactive prompt, type projects to list your projects and project <projectname> to select a current project.
When you run a task like compile, it runs on the current project. So you donâ€™t necessarily have to compile the root project, you could compile only a subproject.

You can run a task in another project by explicitly specifying the project ID, such as subProjectID/compile.
